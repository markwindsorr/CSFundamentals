People use computers to process large amounts of data or solve difficult problems. Two questions arise from the usage of algorithms.

* How long does my algorithm take?
* How much memory will it take?


## Orders-Of-Growth Classifications

|               | Order Of Growth | Description       | Example          |  
| ------------- |:---------------:| -----------------:|-----------------:| 
| Constant      | O(1)            | Statement         | Add 2 numbers    |
| Logarithmic   | O(log n)        | Divide in Half    | Binary Search    |
| Linear        | O(n)            | Simple Loop       | Find maximum     |
| Linearithmic  | O(n log n)      | Divide & Conquer  | Mergesort        |
| Quadratic     | O(n^2)          | Double Loop       | Check All pairs  |
| Cubic         | O(n^2)          | Triple Loop       | Check all triples|
| Exponential   | O(2^n)          | Exhaustive Search | Check all subsets|

# Arrays

A array is a collection of items stored at contiguous (next to each other) memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same data type together. 

___


# Stacks

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) order of operations. We can understand a stack by imagining a stack of plates. Usually when setting the table with a stack of plates, you would use the one on top first.

___

# Queues

A Queue is another linear structure that follows the the First In First Out (FIFO) order of operations. We can understand a queue by imagining a line up of people waiting for something. The item (or person) that was in the queue the longest gets processed first.

___

# Linked Lists

A Linked list is a linear data structure where items are not stored at contiguous locations like arrays, but are linked by pointers which are memory addresses within the computer. Each item in which are usually referred to as nodes, contains the data and a reference to the next null. 

The first entry of a linked list is called the head and the last node points to a null reference indicating the end of the list.

___

# Trees

Unlike arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues, a tree is a non-linear data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of child nodes. 
 
One reason you might want to use trees to store information is that its data is hierarchical in nature, such as a file system on a computer.

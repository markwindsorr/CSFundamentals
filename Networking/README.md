## Web Service

The term web service basically means something that provides some form of communication over the internet. Wikipedia states it can either mean:

* a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device communicating with each other via the World Wide Web or..

* a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving documents (HTML, JSON, XML, images) and creating web application services, which serve in sovling specific domain problems over the web.


### Asynchronous JavaScript & XML (AJAX)

A set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server aynchronously(in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, it allows web pages to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. Most modern implementations commonly use JSON instead of XML.

The ***internet*** is a global network of computers where each computer has its own unique address of the form nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn where nnn is a number between 0 - 255. This address is called an IP address standing for Internet Protocol.

If you connect to the internet through an internet service provider (ISP), you are usually assigned a temporary IP address for the duration of your dial-in session. If you connect to the internet from a local area network (LAN), your computer may have a permanent IP address or it might obtain a temporary one from a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.
